Long Tail Model
===============

A simple R script to compute the Long Tail model of any heavy-tailed distribution. 

This code implements F(x) equation from http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1832/1716
 
The Long Tail of a catalog is measured using the frequency distribution (e.g. purchases, downloads, etc.), ranked by item popularity.
The Long Tail Model models the cumulative distribution of the Long Tail data. 
It also splits the curve in three parts: Head, Mid and Tail.
